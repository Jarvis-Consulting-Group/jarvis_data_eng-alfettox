# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: As a passionate learner of software development and the ever-evolving world of technology, I recently completed my studies in Computer Science and Information Technology at McGill SCS The program provided me with a comprehensive education that prepared me to become a full stack developer. The coursework was both theoretical and practical, consisting of several assignments in each course. As a result, I gained proficiency in various areas, such as front-end development (JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS), back-end (microservices, REST, SOAP) and databases (MySQL and SQL Server). Additionally, I learned OOP, design patterns, algorithms, networking and security. Working on assignments in groups allowed me to apply Agile methodologies, version control, and improved my communication skills. Prior to my current role as a Full Stack Software Developer at Jarvis, I worked as an Architect and Project Coordinator in both Europe and French Canada. These experiences provided me with valuable skills in project management, team coordination, and working collaboratively. At Jarvis, I apply the most modern technologies in the field, which provides me with an opportunity to take on new challenges and grow professionally. I am passionate about technology and committed to enhancing my skills to deliver high-quality software solutions. My previous experiences combined with my technical skills and willingness to learn, allow me to be an asset to any team. I look forward to exploring new opportunities and contributing to the growth of the technology industry.
